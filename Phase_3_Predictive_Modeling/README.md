# Phase 3: Predictive Modeling

This phase focuses on building, evaluating, and interpreting predictive models using the cleaned retail dataset. The workflow includes:

1. **Importing Required Libraries**
2. **Loading and Preparing Data**
3. **Feature Engineering**
4. **Model Selection and Training**
5. **Model Evaluation**
6. **Interpretation and Visualization**
7. **API Integration (using `requests` library)**

All code and explanations are provided in the accompanying Jupyter Notebook (`predictive_modeling.ipynb`).

## Required Libraries

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- requests (for API tasks)

Refer to the notebook for detailed steps, code, and comments explaining each part of the process.
