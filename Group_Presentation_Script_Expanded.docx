Introduction (Speaker 1)

Welcome, everyone. Today, our team will present a comprehensive overview of our data science and AI group project, conducted as part of the ITS2122 course. This project is a culmination of our learning and practical application of data science methodologies, machine learning, and business analytics. We will walk you through each phase of the project, from data cleaning to reflection, highlighting key findings, technical approaches, and business implications. Our goal is to demonstrate not only our technical proficiency but also our ability to derive actionable insights and communicate them effectively.

Project Background

The dataset used in this project is the Online Retail dataset, which contains transactional data for a UK-based online retailer. The data includes information on invoices, products, quantities, prices, customer IDs, and countries. Our objective was to analyze this data to uncover patterns, predict future trends, and provide strategic recommendations for business growth.

Literature Review & Industry Relevance

Before starting, we reviewed relevant literature on retail analytics, customer segmentation, and predictive modeling. The techniques applied in this project are widely used in the industry to optimize inventory, personalize marketing, and improve customer retention.

Phase 1: Data Cleaning (Speaker 1)

Objective: Prepare raw data for analysis by ensuring accuracy, consistency, and completeness.

1. Data Acquisition
   - Loaded the Online Retail dataset using pandas.
   - Verified data integrity and structure.

2. Data Inspection
   - Assessed missing values, duplicate records, and outliers.
   - Used .info(), .describe(), and .isnull().sum() for initial exploration.

3. Handling Missing Values
   - Identified columns with significant nulls (e.g., CustomerID).
   - Imputed missing values where appropriate; removed rows with irreparable gaps.

4. Removing Duplicates
   - Detected and dropped duplicate rows to prevent bias in analysis.

5. Data Type Correction
   - Ensured correct data types for each column (e.g., InvoiceDate as datetime).

6. Outlier Detection
   - Used boxplots and z-score analysis to identify outliers in Quantity and UnitPrice.
   - Investigated negative values and anomalies.

7. Data Consistency
   - Standardized categorical values (e.g., Country names).
   - Checked for logical consistency (e.g., Quantity > 0).

8. Saving Cleaned Data
   - Exported cleaned dataset for use in subsequent phases.

Importance:
   - Data cleaning is foundational. Errors here propagate through the entire analysis, leading to misleading results. Our rigorous approach ensures reliability and reproducibility.

Challenges & Solutions:
   - Dealing with missing CustomerIDs: Decided to exclude these for customer-level analysis but retain for aggregate sales.
   - Handling negative quantities: Investigated as returns/cancellations, treated accordingly.

Phase 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (Speaker 2)

Objective: Uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the data.

1. Descriptive Statistics
   - Calculated mean, median, mode, standard deviation for key variables.
   - Analyzed sales distribution across time, products, and countries.

2. Data Visualization
   - Created histograms, boxplots, scatter plots, and heatmaps using matplotlib and seaborn.
   - Visualized sales trends over time, product popularity, and customer segmentation.

3. Correlation Analysis
   - Used correlation matrices to identify relationships between variables (e.g., Quantity vs. UnitPrice).
   - Detected multicollinearity issues.

4. Customer Segmentation
   - Applied RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to segment customers.
   - Identified high-value customers and churn risks.

5. Product Analysis
   - Ranked products by sales volume and revenue.
   - Identified bestsellers and underperforming items.

6. Time Series Analysis
   - Analyzed monthly and seasonal sales patterns.
   - Detected peaks and troughs, linked to marketing campaigns or holidays.

7. Geographic Analysis
   - Mapped sales by country to identify key markets.

Insights:
   - Discovered that a small percentage of customers account for a large portion of sales (Pareto principle).
   - Seasonal trends suggest opportunities for targeted promotions.

Challenges & Solutions:
   - Dealing with sparse data for some countries: Focused analysis on top markets.
   - Visualizing large datasets: Used sampling and aggregation for clarity.

Phase 3: Predictive Modeling (Speaker 3)

Objective: Build models to predict future sales and customer behavior.

1. Problem Definition
   - Forecast future sales and predict customer churn.

2. Data Preparation
   - Split data into training and testing sets.
   - Scaled features using StandardScaler.

3. Model Selection
   - Evaluated multiple algorithms: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, XGBoost, Logistic Regression.
   - Selected models based on accuracy, interpretability, and business relevance.

4. Model Training
   - Trained models using scikit-learn.
   - Used cross-validation to prevent overfitting.

5. Model Evaluation
   - Assessed performance using metrics: RMSE, MAE, R2 for regression; accuracy, precision, recall, F1 for classification.
   - Compared results across models.

6. Hyperparameter Tuning
   - Used GridSearchCV to optimize model parameters.

7. Feature Importance
   - Analyzed feature importances to understand drivers of sales and churn.

8. Model Interpretation
   - Explained model predictions using SHAP values and partial dependence plots.

9. Deployment Considerations
   - Discussed how models could be integrated into business processes.

Results:
   - Achieved high accuracy in sales forecasting and churn prediction.
   - Identified key factors influencing customer retention.

Challenges & Solutions:
   - Imbalanced data for churn prediction: Used SMOTE to balance classes.
   - Overfitting: Applied regularization and cross-validation.

Phase 4: Reporting and Insights (Speaker 4)

Objective: Communicate findings and recommendations to stakeholders.

1. Executive Summary
   - Summarized key findings and business implications.

2. Visual Reporting
   - Created dashboards using Tableau and Power BI.
   - Included interactive charts and maps for stakeholder engagement.

3. Strategic Recommendations
   - Suggested targeted marketing for high-value customers.
